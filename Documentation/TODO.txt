Operations need to execute in their own thread
Inputs should just be a set operation, not a custom thing
I shouldn't be passing around the data, I should really only have operations return data - atleast if I want to only do block coding
		-Could instead make each variable have a unique identifier - like have the data have the name and an operation for comparison
		then do a comparison where it picks the most recent operation - store all of the operations in order in the data

Fix the XMLParser to load all of the operations from assemblies in an operations folder
Add an option to the base operation config to let you manually set variables (something like <StaticVar methodVar="" value="">) and try to infer the type - Rename the var map and put it in there

When a process errors out - the rest of the process shouldn't run

GUI - A gui library for configuring the starting up thing as well as any kind of form

Generic TypeCasting - 1 Operation that detects the type of the variable and attempts to cast it to the desired type

There should be an overall Option that configures the program as a whole for example for logs
Operations:
	String templating
	Lists
	Database operations
	HTTP requests
	JSON and XML
	File Write Operations
	GUIInput - Parent of many other guis - Configurable form gui for lazy gui coding
	Persistent Variable save
	Schema validation
	Fix onError in base operation to print a log
	Is is possible to dynamically compile code to run a method? so basically I can just run methods that aren't involved in the code for testing
