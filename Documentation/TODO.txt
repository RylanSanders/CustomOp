Operations need to execute in their own thread
Inputs should just be a set operation, not a custom thing
I shouldn't be passing around the data, I should really only have operations return data - atleast if I want to only do block coding
		-Could instead make each variable have a unique identifier - like have the data have the name and an operation for comparison
		then do a comparison where it picks the most recent operation - store all of the operations in order in the data

Fix the XMLParser to load all of the operations from assemblies in an operations folder
Add an option to the base operation config to let you manually set variables (something like <StaticVar methodVar="" value="">) and try to infer the type
Operations:
	String templating
	Database operations
	HTTP requests
	File Write Operations
	GUIInput - Parent of many other guis - Configurable form gui for lazy gui coding
